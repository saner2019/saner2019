                The workshop will focus on intelligent bug fixing. Generally, bug fixing process includes bug understanding (i.e., bug reproduction, severity/priority verification, bug summarization, bug classification, bug knowledge extraction), bug localization, bug fixing, and bug validation. By using data mining, information retrieval, machine learning, natural language processing, artificial intelligence technologies, visualization technologies, human-computer Interaction technologies and code analysis technologies, a series of new automated algorithms will be proposed to improve the performance of developers bug fixing process. In this workshop, we solicit high-quality contributions with consolidated and thoroughly evaluated application-oriented research results in the area of intelligent bug fixing. It is intended to (i) provide a summary of research that advances intelligent bug fixing using multiple data analysis and processing techniques, and (ii) serve as a comprehensive collection of some of the current state-of-the-art technologies within this content.
