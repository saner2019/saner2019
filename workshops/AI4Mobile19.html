                The first International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence for Mobile (AI4Mobile'19) aims to bring
                together international researchers and practitioners in the field of both artificial intelligence and
                mobile app analysis to exchange and discuss the most recent synergistic artificial intelligence (AI) for
                mobile applications, systems, and security. We would welcome original articles on every aspect related
                to AI for mobile apps analysis and vice versa. We hope that AI4Mobile could facilitate to create
                intelligent, high-quality, and secure mobile applications, as well as accelerate the process of
                intelligent mobile applications development.
            </p>
            <p>For example, we particularly welcome submissions providing (1) methodological and technical foundations
                of automated mobile app analysis using AI, (2) experimental studies and industrial applications to
                mobile app analyses in a perspective of AI, and (3) new research perspectives based on mobile data such
                as blockchain and artificial intelligence technology.</p>
            <p>With this workshop, we seek for original and novel research papers as well as experimental studies on all
                theoretical and practical aspects of mobile app analysis. Areas of interest include but are not
                restricted to:
