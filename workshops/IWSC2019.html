                Software clones are often a result of copying and pasting as an act of
                ad-hoc reuse by programmers, and can occur at many levels, from simple
                statement sequences to blocks, methods, classes, source files,
                subsystems, models, architectures and entire designs, and in all
                software artifacts (code, models, requirements or architecture
                documentation, etc.). Software clone research is of high relevance for
                software engineering research and practice today.
            </p>
            <p>
                IWSC series of events has provided a common forum for this important
                research area as it continues to grow in application breadth and
                technical depth. IWSC aims to bring researchers and practitioners to
                evaluate the current state of research, discuss common problems and
                emerging directions. Also, we are interested in discussing and spreading
                practical applications of clone technologies. Further details about IWSC 2019
                are here on this website (https://iwsc2019.github.io).
