                A blockchain is a distributed ledger for recording transactions, maintained by many nodes without
                central authority through a distributed cryptographic protocol. All nodes validate the information to be
                appended to the blockchain, and a consensus protocol ensures that the nodes agree on a unique order in
                which entries are appended. This prominent feature of blockchain is well known after the success of its
                early digital cryptocurrency applications known as Bitcoin. Nowadays more and more innovative
                applications are using blockchain to explore many new innovative digital financial applications and
                various decentralized applications that eliminate the need for 3rd party intermediaries, such as
                identity management, credit management, distrusted/public/shared ledger, crowd-funding, P2P insurance,
                smart contracts, supply chain management, online voting and medical records. We aim to advance the state
                of the art in security of blockchain technology and analysis. The aim of this workshop is to bring
                together researchers and practitioners working in distributed systems, cryptography, and security, from
                academia and industry, who are interested in the technology and analysis of blockchains and their
                protocols.
