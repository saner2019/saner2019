                The workshop’s goal is to gather together practitioners and researchers to discuss on progresses on the research and on the practical usage of blockchain technologies and smart contracts, focusing on the application and definition of software engineering principles and practices specific for such software technology, and for the technologies relying on it. The workshop calls researches on specific tools, paradigms, principles, approaches to deal with the new challenges posed by Blockchain technology to software engineers and for a specific Blockchain Oriented Software Engineering.
