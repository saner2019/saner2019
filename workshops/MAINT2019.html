                While at first sight IDEs may appear as 'just' glorified text editors, they are composed of a
                multi-faceted set of UIs designed to support various development tasks at hand, like navigation of code
                entities, refactoring, and debugging. The interaction of the developer with the IDE and its UIs
                generates a continuous stream of events, called interaction data or interaction histories, that provides
                a unique valuable resource to characterize, from a quantitative point of view, the diverse mechanics of
                software development.
            </p>

            <p>
                The intrinsic potential of interaction histories has attracted a lot of interest in the research
                community. While the pioneering technique can be considered the work of Mylyn by Kersten and Murphy, in
                the last decade researchers developed numerous approaches to record more fine-grained events in the IDE.
                On top of the recorded data, researchers have been investigating how to leverage it to quantify the time
                spent on programming activities or understanding the mechanics of development. Furthermore, some authors
                started investigating how biometric data can be leveraged to characterize other perspectives on the
                behavior of developers, e.g., their cognitive effort through the proxy of eye movements, or their
                emotions and feelings during programming.
            </p>
            <p>
                This workshop aims to bring together researcher and practitioners in the area of Software Engineering
                that are currently studying or are interested to investigate the specific topic of interaction data. Our
                workshop intends to discuss a specific (but not exhaustive) set of open problems and topics in the area.
                These topics will be presented by candidate authors through a specific set of submission types, which
                include both research and position papers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The intrinsic nature and largely unexplored potential of interaction data, raise a number of issues that
                we believe can be addressed in the context of the MAINT workshop:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>How is it possible to preserve developer and company privacy when recording interaction histories
                    while still collecting meaningful and actionable data?
                </li>
                <li> How is it possible to capture and integrate interaction data involving tools that programmers use
                    outside the IDE (e.g., web browser, Q&A services)?
                </li>
                <li> Is it possible to agree on common meta-model for interaction data so that researchers can analyze
                    and leverage interaction data coming from different tools and IDEs?
                </li>
                <li> How can interaction histories support researchers in understanding, from a qualitative point of
                    view, the mechanics of programming?
                </li>
                <li> How is it possible to identify and abstract high-level programming activities from interaction
                    histories?
                </li>
                <li> How is it possible to perform real-time analytics of interaction histories to proactively support
                    developers during their current tasks?
                </li>
                <li> Which biometric data can complement and improve the effectiveness of interaction histories?</li>
                <li> How can interaction histories support and improve approaches like defect prediction?</li>
            </ul>
