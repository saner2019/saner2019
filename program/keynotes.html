                    Software engineering has generally done a good job of building software systems with the intended
                    functionality and cost and that is safe, secure and reliable. However, there is a broader set of
                    human values -- such as transparency, integrity, diversity, compassion, social justice -- that are
                    largely ignored when we develop software systems. In this talk, I will argue that software
                    development methods should place more emphasis on these human values so we do a better job of
                    building software that aligns with our individual, corporate or societal values. Furthermore,
                    drawing on recent evidence from case studies in industry, I will argue that dealing with human
                    values in software systems is not just of interest to a small group of organisations; rather, all
                    software projects should think about human values, build them in where appropriate, test for them,
                    and use them to drive design decisions. When they are not dealt with in this way, there can be
                    severe social and economic consequences.

                    Jon Whittle is Executive Dean of the Faculty of Information Technology at Monash University,
                    Melbourne, and Professor of Software Engineering. Before joining Monash, Jon was Head of the School
                    of Computing and Communications at Lancaster University, UK. Jon’s research spans software
                    engineering and human-computer interaction. In software engineering, he is best known for his work
                    on program and design synthesis, model-driven development and aspect-oriented modelling. He is a
                    past recipient of the Royal Society’s Wolfson Merit Fellowship, a Pilkington Teaching Award for his
                    studio-based approach to software engineering education, and an IEE Software Premium Award. He has
                    also received a number of Best Paper awards or nominations at ICSE, ASE, MODELS, CSEE&T and CHI. Jon
                    has Chaired a number of prestigious software engineering conferences and is Co-Chairing ICSE 2019
                    with Tevfik Bultan. Currently, Jon’s research focuses on IT for social good and, in particular, how
                    to reimagine software design methodologies to embed social values.
