                    Software engineering has generally done a good job of building software systems with the intended
                    functionality and cost and that is safe, secure and reliable. However, there is a broader set of
                    human values -- such as transparency, integrity, diversity, compassion, social justice -- that are
                    largely ignored when we develop software systems. In this talk, I will argue that software
                    development methods should place more emphasis on these human values so we do a better job of
                    building software that aligns with our individual, corporate or societal values. Furthermore,
                    drawing on recent evidence from case studies in industry, I will argue that dealing with human
                    values in software systems is not just of interest to a small group of organisations; rather, all
                    software projects should think about human values, build them in where appropriate, test for them,
                    and use them to drive design decisions. When they are not dealt with in this way, there can be
                    severe social and economic consequences.

                    engineering and human-computer interaction. In software engineering, he is best known for his work
                    on program and design synthesis, model-driven development and aspect-oriented modelling. He is a
                    past recipient of the Royal Society’s Wolfson Merit Fellowship, a Pilkington Teaching Award for his
                    studio-based approach to software engineering education, and an IEE Software Premium Award. He has
                    also received a number of Best Paper awards or nominations at ICSE, ASE, MODELS, CSEE&T and CHI. Jon
                    has Chaired a number of prestigious software engineering conferences and is Co-Chairing ICSE 2019
                    with Tevfik Bultan. Currently, Jon’s research focuses on IT for social good and, in particular, how
                    to reimagine software design methodologies to embed social values.

                    Machine Learning (ML) advances continue to be headline news. Enormous investments are being poured
                    into Data Science (DS) and Artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives worldwide. Hiring managers are
                    turning every rock looking for ML, DS, and AI experts and even novices! Forbes proclaims software
                    engineers will be replaced by deep learners in the not so distant future.
                    In this talk I will highlight the crucial role of Software Engineering (SE) in this ML\DS\AI future.
                    I will follow it up with a critical look at many of the challenges and risks that such sophisticated
                    advances bring to software research and practice.

                    Traceability is originally one of the essential activities of good requirements management for
                    ensuring that the right products are being built at each phase of the software development life
                    cycle. The forward traceability has been posed for tracing the progress of the development and to
                    analyze the impacts of the changed requirements for reducing the changing efforts. It will become
                    more important in the resilient cyber-physical systems as such a system need not only to replicate
                    or modify itself but also to develop the design by which it is replicated or modified. For these
                    systems, bi-directional traceability is highly demanded and to some sense becomes an embedded
                    capability of the systems. This talk will analyze the requirements and the technique challenges of
                    built-in bi-directional traceability in resilient cyber-physical systems.
