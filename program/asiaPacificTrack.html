                    Software developers author a wide variety of documents written in natural language, ranging from commit messages and source code comments to documentation and questions or answers on Stack Overflow. To automatically make sense of these natural language artefacts and to make it easier for software developers to access the knowledge contained in them, we have developed various techniques that rely on natural language processing (NLP). This talk will highlight several such approaches, including a hypernym-discovery tool for software technologies, a badge-generator for sections of GitHub README files, and a task-based search interface for software documentation. In addition, we highlight challenges associated with applying NLP libraries to software artefacts. Our work suggests that while much of the knowledge needed by software developers is already available somewhere, much work is needed to enable developers to access it easily.

                    The rise of library ecosystems and third-party dependencies usage is now common practice in contemporary software development.
                    Library dependencies in constant need of updating, with newly added features and patches that fix bugs in older versions.
                    Especially in terms of vulnerabilities, developers are faced with keeping the latest version, as this can lead to disastrous effects like the npm 'left-pad' incident. 
                    Furthermore, with massive ecosystems of library data available, in this presentation, I introduce the current state of research and practice, the challenges and how we work towards more intelligent updates of our software.

                    We are now at the age of big data, where lots of software and unstructured data are invading our daily life. To cope with this, mining software repositories (MSR) has emerged as a new research topic aiming at mining those data for uncovering interesting and actionable information about software systems and projects. As an example demonstrating the usefulness of MSR, this talk will focus on mining the Android framework code base to support the understanding of Android APIs. More specifically, this talk will attempt to answer API-related questions such as how do Android APIs evolve over time, how are Android APIs deprecated, how are Android APIs involved compatibility issues, etc.

                   The history of software development is always connected with the fight against software bugs. Automated program repair (APR) has been expected to end the fight. APR enables to automatically generate a source code patch that makes all failing test cases pass. The field of APR is still young, and there remain many challenges that we need to overcome.
                   In this talk, I introduce fundamentals of the concept of APR. Then, I present and demonstrate a new APR system, named kGenProg, which aims to provide high-performance, high-extensibility, and high-portability program repair.

                    Developers increasingly rely on text matching tools to analyze the relation between natural language words and APIs. However, semantic gaps, namely textual mismatches between words and APIs, negatively affect these tools. Previous studies have transformed words or APIs into low-dimensional vectors for matching; however, inaccurate results were obtained due to the failure of modeling words and APIs simultaneously. To resolve this problem, two main challenges are to be addressed: the acquisition of massive words and APIs for mining and the alignment of words and APIs for modeling. Therefore, we propose Word2API to effectively estimate relatedness of words and APIs. Word2API collects millions of commonly used words and APIs from code repositories to address the acquisition challenge. Then, a shuffling strategy is used to transform related words and APIs into tuples to address the alignment challenge. Using these tuples, Word2API models words and APIs simultaneously. Word2API outperforms baselines by 10%-49.6% of relatedness estimation in terms of precision and NDCG. Word2API is also effective on solving typical software tasks, e.g., query expansion and API documents linking.

                    Program comprehension is traditionally labor-intensive and can take more than 50% of developer time during software development and maintenance. It is very desirable to automate program comprehension, to facilitate developers in understanding code, coding for new features, fixing bugs, detecting malware, etc. Deep neural networks are poised to fill the gap by learning from numerous code repositories accumulated on the Internet over the years and reusing the learned knowledge. How far are the techniques from realizing this dream of automated program comprehension? This talk shares some experiences in using various deep learning techniques for program classification, and discuss various challenges and opportunities in deep learning of code. Different from the notion of "big code", we notice that the amount of data really available for learning may still be insufficient for various software engineering tasks. And, encoding code and diverse contextual information about the code in a suitable, unified form for a chosen neural network can be a critical factor for successful learning. Much more efforts are still needed in exploring optimal combinations of code analysis, representation and learning techniques for better results for different tasks. An inclusive, failure-embracing, data-sharing community will be important for collectively achieving the goal of automated code comprehension.
