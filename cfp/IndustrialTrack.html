        <h2>Industrial Track - Call for Papers </h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The industry track is one of the most fundamental components for the software engineering community.
            The 26th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER’19) highlights
            these practical and industrial studies. This platform bridges the people from industry and academia to
            network,
            foster innovations and build strong collaborations.
            The papers in the industrial track follow the general topics specified in the SANER 2019 research track.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 15px;">
            We are eager to understand the results, problems, practices, obstacles, and lessons in the industry.
            The submissions can share real-world gain and loss experience, evidence,
            or the lessons applying state-of-the-art methods, techniques and tools to industrial software.
            The new ideas and unsolved challenges are also strongly welcome.
            The authors should explicitly describe the topics wanted to be solved and/or discussed.
            A good paper should precisely describe the context, problems, the current state of the projects,
            an evaluation of the benefits or lessons learned, and future developments.
        </p>

        <strong>Submission Instructions</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Submissions should be at most 5 pages (including all text, references, appendices,
            and figures) and conform to the IEEE proceedings style (i.e., the same used from the main SANER conference).
            All submissions have to be written exclusively in English. Submissions must not have been previously
            published
            or concurrently submitted elsewhere.
            Papers must be submitted in PDF format electronically through EasyChair <a
                href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2019">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=saner2019</a>.
        </p>

        <br>
        <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            All submissions will be reviewed by at least three program committee members
            of the industrial track. These papers will be evaluated based on four criteria:
            industry relevance, originality, soundness, validation and quality and consistency
            of presentation. The whole review process strictly follows the full
            <under>double-blind
                review policy
            </under>
            . Submissions that do not adhere to these limits or that violate the
            formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected without review.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Note that upon notification of acceptance, all authors of accepted papers need to complete an
            IEEE Copyright form and will receive further instructions for preparing their camera ready versions.
            At least one author of each paper needs to present the results at the SANER 2019 conference.
            All accepted contributions will be published in the conference electronic proceedings.
