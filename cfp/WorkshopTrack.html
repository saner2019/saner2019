        <h2>Workshop Track - Call for Papers </h2>
        <hr>
        <p style="text-align:justify;">
            We solicit proposals for workshops to be held in conjunction with the main SANER conference.
            Workshops should highlight topics of interest related to software analysis, evolution, and reengineering,
            and should provide concrete opportunities for researchers to exchange and debate scientific ideas at an early stage,
            before they are solid and mature enough for publication in conference or journal venues.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            We encourage workshop organizers to include usual conference-like sessions like keynotes and paper presentations,
            but most importantly, activities that provide their participants with a true workshop experience,
            including (but not limited to) tool demo sessions, tutorials, panels, poster presentations, and discussion sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Workshops can be organized as full-day or half-day events.
        </p>

        <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 15px;">
            Submissions will be evaluated by the track co-chairs.
            The evaluation will focus on the novelty, originality,
            and importance to the field of the workshop topics,
            and on the adequate structure of proposed sessions.
        </p>
