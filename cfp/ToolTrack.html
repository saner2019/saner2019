            <h2>Tool Demo Track - Call for Papers </h2>
            <hr>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The Tool Demonstration track is a valuable venue of the 26th International
                Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution, and Reengineering (SANER'19). The
                goal of this track is to promote live presentations of tool prototypes.
                Software Tools are fundamental for the research in software maintenance,
                reverse engineering, and reengineering. These tool demonstrations have a
                prominent role in the SANER'19 conference, which substantially increases the
                visibility of the research associated to such tools.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                The demonstrations are expected to showcase tools that implement research
                approaches. The tools may range from mature prototypes to fully developed
                products that have not been commercialized yet. We encourage demonstration
                proposals that complement full research papers. For example, while a research
                paper provides the background information and the scientific contribution of a
                novel approach, a tool demonstration shows how such an approach has been
                converted into a running prototype. Thus, the authors of potential research
                papers are encouraged to submit their respective tools to this track. Any of
                the topics covered by the SANER'19 conference are appropriate for this track.
            </p>
            <br>
            <strong>Evaluation Criteria</strong>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Each submission will be reviewed by at least three members of the tool
                demonstration program committee. The committee will review each submission
                based on the innovation, effort, relevance, and quality of the submission.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                <strong>Important note</strong>: SANER 2019 follows a full double-blind review process. For
                details see the Instructions for Authors. Submissions that do not adhere to
                these limits or that violate the formatting guidelines will be desk-rejected
                without review.
            </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;">A good tool paper should:</p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-top: 15px;">
            <ul>

                <li> Fall under the topics mentioned in the SANER 2019 research track;</li>

                <li> Present and discuss a tool that has NOT been published before as a tool paper;</li>

                <li> Motivate the need for the tool;</li>

                <li> Describe the novelty of the tool;</li>

                <li> Describe how the tool is related to efforts in academia and industry;</li>

                <li> Clearly explain the goals, requirements, architecture, and inner workings of the tool;</li>

                <li> NOT necessarily contain a large-scale empirical study of the tool, BUT any empirical results or
                    user feedback are highly encouraged;
                </li>

                <li> Optionally include in the abstract the URL of a 3-to-5 minute screencast
                    (either with annotations or voice-over), providing a concise version of the
                    tool demo scenario. The video should be posted on YouTube (private, not
                    shared) or hosted on the tool’s website.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <strong>Submission Instructions</strong>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Submissions of tool demonstrations must:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adhere to the conference proceedings style (IEEE proceedings paper format
                    guidelines.); have a maximum of 5 pages that falls under the aforementioned
                    criteria; be uploaded electronically in PDF format via the SANER 2019
                    Easychair submission site.
                </li>
                <li>Accepted tool demonstrations will be allocated 5 pages in the conference
                    proceedings. Demonstrators will be invited to (i) present their tool as per
                    scheduled in the conference program, and (ii) participate in a hands-on
                    session in which SANER attendants will use and experiment the tools.
                    Commercial products or products that have already been commercialized will not
                    be accepted. The purpose of the demonstrations is to highlight scientific
                    contributions and, as such, should not be used as sales pitches.
