    <h4><strong>Public Transportation in Hangzhou:</strong></h4>
    <p>The public transport in Hangzhou is quite convenient, if you want to take a taxi, ask the hotel reception for arrangement. And just in front of the gate of hotel, there is a bus station. The red circles are the nearest metro station.  Moreover, Hangzhou has the best public bicycle system in China, and we also have lots of shared bicycle around the city, so we strongly recommend you to cycle around the west lake after meeting. We hope you would have a chance to enjoy experience that is uniquely Hangzhou during your visit here.</p>
